Challenge

At Vroom, we do a lot of searches related to vehicles. For this exercise, we would like for a user to be able to do a partial text search for vehicle manufacturer and see a list of possible choices. When they select one of the choices on the list, it will display in a modal, details of the manufacturer like a list of their locations.
You may use any frontend framework that you are comfortable with or use pure vanilla JavaScript for this exercise. Consider styling. Wherever you can, please include any relevant comments or documentation on the choices you made.
